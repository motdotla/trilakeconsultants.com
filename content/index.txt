Tri Lake Consultants was founded in 1988 by company president Habib Motlagh, PE. At that time the company had one client, the City of Perris, and only four employees. Over the course of two decades Tri Lake has grown to become the leading source of contract municipal engineering services in Riverside County, with over 40 employees working with six different agencies. By catering exclusively to public agencies, Tri Lake serves its clients with a high level of integrity and without conflicts of interest.

Since its inception, Tri Lake Consultants has always been focused on a client-first model for doing business, delivering high quality projects in a timely manner and at a reasonable cost.
